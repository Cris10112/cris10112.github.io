    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>The key structure of this black box is that there has to be some mechanism that holds a certain amount of water and can be able to release it. There is probably a reservoir that holds some amount of water in the black box.</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>The initial observations that we could see when testing the black box was that you could pour 500ml into it but nothing would come out and sometimes a little or more could come out. Our approach to figuring out how it works was to test the amount of water we put into the box. we put 100 ml of water in and sometimes nothing came out. Our model's key structure was that it would need to have a reservoir that was a little more than 500ml so that it would be able to explain why the black box had the same trial where nothing came out after pouring 500ml. We tested our model by keeping the amount of water that we poured constant to make sure that we would get similar results as the real black box. When we would pour 500ml we would get less 450ml or sometimes we would get more 530ml.</p>
    <h1>Reasoning 1</h1>
    <p>Models are used to explain things that you don't really know what they look like to better understand them. They can be very useful for the simple understanding of things that are complex. For example,  people made models for atoms even though they never knew what they looked like but based the model on the observation and facts that they had. Their strengths are that they help understand but their limitations are that they are not always correct and might need revision.
</p>
    <h1>Reasoning 2</h1>
    <p>You should believe our claim because we can explain why there was a trial that 500ml was poured and nothing came out and our data table also shows constant change in the amount of water lost and gained when pouring 500ml each time.</p>
    <h1>Reasoning 3</h1>
    <p>Our test model sometimes doesn't compare to the amount of time that is used on the real black box. Sometimes the rate at which the water comes out is way too fast probably due to the amount of time the water travels in our model.</p>
